--- Response ---
I have checked on employee Mary Boyd for client 132. Here’s what I found:

- Employee: Mary Boyd (ID: J00809) is in your system as an employee for client 132.
- Payroll Activity: She has active payroll records in 2024, with the last pay date being **December 27, 2024**. Each recent week shows regular earnings and direct deposit activity.

**Conclusion:**  
Mary Boyd is still being paid as of the most recent payrolls. If she is no longer working for your organization, her payroll has not yet been stopped in the system. I recommend taking action to update her employment status or reaching out to your payroll administrator to terminate further payments.

If you need step-by-step help in stopping her payroll or terminating her in the system, let me know and I can guide you!

--- Response ---
To answer your inquiry ("What benefit plans are available and which employees from client 132 are enrolled in each plan?") for your benefits audit, I will follow the correct endpoint flow according to the PrismHR documentation:

**Step 1: Get all benefit plans available for client 132.**
- Endpoint: get_client_benefit_plans (client_id = "132")
- This gives the list of benefit plans for client 132.

**Step 2: For each benefit plan, determine which employees are enrolled.**
- First, get all employees for client 132 (get_employee_list).
- Then, for each employee, get their active benefit plans (get_active_benefit_plans), and see which plan(s) they are enrolled in.

I'll retrieve the benefit plans for client 132, then get the list of employees, and cross-reference enrollment. Let's start:

If Mary believes she should have bank account details on file for payroll, she may need to update her direct deposit information or contact HR/payroll for assistance. If she expects an account to be on file, it's possible it was not entered, has expired, or there is a technical issue.

Arguments: {"client_id":"132","employee_id":"S00816","options":"Tax"}

--- Response ---
The PrismHR API does not provide W-4 or tax withholding setup directly via an "options" parameter for the get_employee endpoint. However, the W-4 tax elections for an employee are typically managed as part of payroll deductions and tax setup in the PrismHR system.

**Here's what I was able to do:**
- I identified Debra Barksdale as employee ID S00816 for client 132.
- Employee personal info is available, but tax withholding elections (like W-4 Federal/State allowances, additional withholdings) are NOT accessible directly via the get_employee endpoint options.

**Next Step:**
To view or verify Debra Barksdale's W-4 elections (federal/state tax withholding settings), you will likely need:
1. An administrator or payroll manager with PrismHR backend access to pull the employee's tax setup.
2. Use the PrismHR ESS (employee self-service) portal, where the latest W-4 (or state equivalent) selections and their current effective elections are typically available for the employee to review.

**API Limitation:**  
The API currently does not return W-4 form data or display current W-4 selections for an employee.

**Recommendation:**  
- Please log in to your PrismHR HRIS or ESS portal as either the employee (Debra Barksdale) or as an admin/payroll manager.  
- Navigate to Debra's employee profile  
- Go to the "Taxes" or "W-4" section/tab  
- Review the currently effective W-4 form and tax withholding selections (allowances, extra withholding, marital status, etc.)

If you need help finding this screen in the web portal, let me know! If your organization has a specific API endpoint or report for W-4 data, please provide further detail, and I can assist with that flow.

--- Response ---
After checking all active employees in client 132 and their benefit enrollments, **none of the currently active employees (IDs: J00809, K00810, L00811, M00812, S00816, T00817) are enrolled in a 401k plan**.

**Findings:**
- Each employee’s active benefit plans (based on "planId", and "description") were reviewed.
- No currently active employee has a 401k or retirement plan enrollment listed among their active benefit plans. The plans found are medical, dental, vision, life, disability, or other non-retirement benefits.

**If you expected some employees to be enrolled in a 401k plan:**
- It might be that enrollment is not reflected as an "Active Benefit Plan" but somewhere else, or the benefit plan is named differently—please provide a specific 401k plan ID or description if you have one.
- Alternatively, the 401k/retirement plan may not be currently active for any employee.

Do you want me to check for retired, terminated, or previous employees, or search using additional criteria?
